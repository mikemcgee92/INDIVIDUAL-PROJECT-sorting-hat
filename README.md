## About the User 
- The ideal user is a teacher or team leader
- They would like to use a randomized sort to assign groups
- The problem this app solves is allowing users to input names and sort randomly into groups without the need for more decision making or perihpherals like dice or cards

## Features 
- Ability to add new students and have them randomly sorted into 4 houses, then each one gets a card output to the DOM.
- Each card is colored based on house for extra readability.
- The user can filter the output so that it only shows cards from specific groups
- Entries that are 'expelled' from the roster show up in a separate category called Voldemort's Army.
